# Public Key Cryptography or Asymmetric Cryptography

In public key encryption systems, two keys are used: a private and a public key. The security relies on keeping the private key secret. The public key can be distributed freely without compromising security. 

For a private and public key pair it is true that:
- Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. 
- Messages encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the private key.

Asymmetric encryption is relatively slow so often it is just used to exchange a secret key securely, which can then be used for symmetric encryption.
